        <p><strong>Software Engineering Internship;</strong> Repurpost</p>
      </dd>

    <p>
      During this internship I helped build a native iOS and Android mobile
      application in React Native for Repurpost. The application allows a user
      to manage different types of content from different platforms like
      Instagram, Wordpress and Facebook. During this internship I had the
      valuable experience of taking on team lead responsibilities in an
      Agile/SCRUM team. I personally contributed to the implementation of this
      project by writing much of the controller logic to manage Views, perform
      state management and interact with our backend via asynchronous AJAX
      requests. I also contributed by doing UI/UX work with the Native Base
      component library and by mapping out high level UML models during the
      desing phase.

        My experience as a Supplamental Instructor and Tutor at Hartnell College culminated with me participating as a presenter at the CA Perkins Joint Special Populations Annual 2019 Conference. I was personally representing Hartnell College's embedded tutoring program as well as our online tutoring program and gave a presentation regarding our innovation in these areas.
        As a Tutor and SI, I worked with students in various different sub-disciplines related to computer scicnce, math and English.
        Some of these topics included object oriented programming in C++, discrete mathematics, first and second semester calculus as well as algebra, critical thinking, and english.

          For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition list
          can be used to have named items.

        <ul>
          <li>
            These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the

          you implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or
          <strong>node.js</strong> (with <a href="http://nodejs.org">link</a>)

          <strong>first-lang:</strong> Here, we have an itemization, where we
          only want to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want
          to mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
          here is a description list where the first few items have their first
          word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few emphasized
          terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf version, which
          wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.
